# 🛒 Trolley Budget Scanner

The **Trolley Budget Scanner** is an innovative solution designed to streamline the shopping experience by automatically tracking the total cost of items in a trolley in real-time.  

In today's fast-paced world , shoppers often face the inconvenience of manually calculating their purchases, leading to unexpected totals, overspending, or wasted time. This project addresses this problem by integrating a smart scanning system into shopping trolleys that scans barcodes as items are added, providing a running total of the expenditure.
