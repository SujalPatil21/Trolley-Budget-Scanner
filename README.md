# Trolley-Budget-Scanner
 
The Trolley Budget Scanner is an innovative solution designed to streamline the shopping experience by
automatically tracking the total cost of items in a trolley in real-time. In today's fast-paced world, shoppers often
face the inconvenience of manually calculating their purchases, leading to unexpected totals at checkout,
overspending, or time wasted. This project aims to address this problem by integrating a smart scanning system into
shopping trolleys that scans barcodes as items are placed inside, providing a running total of the expenditure. The
system will be designed to ensure accurate cost calculations, notify users if their budget limit is exceeded, and
reduce checkout time. By eliminating the guesswork in budget management, the Trolley Budget Scanner enhances
efficiency, convenience, and user satisfaction in retail environments. The project's conclusion highlights its potential
to improve the overall shopping experience through automated, budget-conscious technology, reducing errors and
enhancing time management for both customers and retailers.
